- Representation of the fx_2500 calculator with limited functionality:
    airthmetic operations, sin and sqrt

- Expected screen-size for whole calculator to be on screen: (>= 700) x (>= 950)
- The on/off button was implemented; first time page loads, on/off 
    needs to be pressed twice for it to turn on the calculator
- The AC and C buttons were implemented; both reset screen to "0"
- When buttons "+", "-", "*" and "/" are pressed contents of the screen are replaced
    with second input for operation; the "=" button then computes the result
- the "sin" and "sqrt" buttons immediately operate on the contents of the screen
    and replace it with the result
